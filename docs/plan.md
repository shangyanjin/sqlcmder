# MVC Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to refactor the SQLCmder project from its current monolithic UI structure to a clean Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The refactoring aims to improve code maintainability, testability, and scalability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Current Project Structure
```
sqlcmder/
├── ui/                    # All UI components mixed together
├── internal/
│   ├── app/              # Application core
│   ├── config/           # Configuration management
│   ├── commands/         # Command processing
│   ├── drivers/          # Database drivers
│   ├── keymap/           # Key mapping
│   ├── logger/           # Logging
│   └── storage/          # Data storage
├── models/               # Data models
└── services/             # Business services (if created)
```

### Current Issues
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: UI components contain business logic
- **Tight Coupling**: Components are tightly coupled to each other
- **Hard to Test**: Business logic mixed with UI makes testing difficult
- **Poor Maintainability**: Changes require modifications across multiple files
- **Limited Reusability**: Components cannot be easily reused

## Proposed MVC Architecture

### 1. Model Layer (Data Layer)
```

├── table.go             # Table model
├── database.go          # Database model
└── constants.go         # Constants definition
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Define data structures
- Handle data validation
- Provide data access methods
- No business logic or UI dependencies

### 2. View Layer (Presentation Layer)
```
views/
├── pages/
│   ├── home.go          # Home page view
│   ├── connection.go     # Connection page view
│   └── editor.go        # Editor view
├── components/
│   ├── table.go         # Table component
│   ├── tree.go          # Tree component
│   ├── sidebar.go       # Sidebar component
│   └── command_line.go  # Command line component
├── modals/
│   ├── help.go          # Help modal
│   ├── query_history.go # Query history modal

├── command_controller.go # Command controller
└── editor_controller.go # Editor controller
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Handle user input events
- Coordinate between models and views
- Manage application state
- Process business logic through services

### 4. Service Layer (Business Logic Layer)
```
services/
├── database_service.go  # Database service
├── query_service.go     # Query service
├── connection_service.go # Connection service
├── history_service.go   # History service
└── saved_service.go     # Saved queries service
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Implement business logic
- Process complex operations
- Coordinate multiple repositories
- Provide high-level APIs to controllers

### 5. Repository Layer (Data Access Layer)
```
repositories/
├── connection_repository.go # Connection data access
├── query_repository.go      # Query data access
├── history_repository.go    # History data access
└── saved_repository.go      # Saved queries data access
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Abstract data access
- Handle data persistence
- Provide CRUD operations
- Isolate data storage implementation

## Refactoring Phases
